  I designed and developed a custom hospital management system from scratch, then deployed and shared the web application with the FADHRIS Haiti team at the request of their IT manager. The system streamlines patient record management, admissions, and resource tracking, providing insightful dashboards and reliable data accessibility for healthcare operations.
